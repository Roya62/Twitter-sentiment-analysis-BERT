**Data Description

Twitter is a social networking and real-time microblogging service. Messages posted by Twitter users are called tweets and restricted to a length of 140 characters. Usually, tweets can be considered informal to contain colloquial language, emoticons, and numerous spelling errors. Another characteristic of Twitter is the use of hashtags to refer to specific topics.

The first dataset was created by CrowdFlower  but filtered a lot by Chanran Kim . The dataset was named "apple-twitter-sentiment-texts.csv", and it was about the tweets post by different people about apple products on Twitter. 

The second dataset used in this study was obtained from the Kaggle website and was created by William Jiang .  The dataset is named "Big Tech Companies - Tweet Sentiment.csv" and reviews ten major tech companies. The author of the data has created two different datasets of tweets fetched from two different time frames. The first dataset contains tweets brought from 20-09- 2020 till 13-10-2020 and has about 266 thousand rows. The second dataset includes tweets that were fetched from 12-07-2020 till 19-09-2020 and contains approximately 860 thousand rows. For this research, the smaller dataset, which includes 266 thousand rows, was used.  
Reviews related to the tech companies were collected from Twitter. The hashtag method was used in retrieving the tweets. Hashtags used to convey the tweets were:  Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, Twitch, AMD, and Tesla. Each row represents a tweet about these companies.
